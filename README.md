# Data Visualization Project
For this project, we compare 2 different datasets: vaccination rates by age and positive covid rates over time to see what effect vaccines had in the reduction of covid cases. The datasets can be found in the Ontario data catalog https://data.ontario.ca/organization/health. 

## Motivation
Our motivation for this study came from the curiosity of understanding how effective these vaccination campaigns were throughout the pandemic. While many vaccines were distributed across Ontario, the number of doses taken varied across age groups. This raised the question of how effective these vaccines were in battling the COVID-19 pandemic. By comparing two data sets about confirmed positive COVID-19 cases and vaccination rates among different age cohorts, we want to find out whether there is a connection between higher vaccination rates and a decrease in COVID-19 cases within the same age group.
